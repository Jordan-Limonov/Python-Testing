A number of them, influenced by the thought of French utopian socialist Charles Fourier, founded a club dedicated to creating a society based on his ideas in 1843 and organized a \"phalanx\" (a communal living complex) in Fond du Lac county the following year. Notable members of the club include Charles Durkee, the first Republican member of the US Senate; Louis Harney, who would later become Governor; and Charles Latham Sholes, newspaper editor and inventor of the QWERTY keyboard. The commune disbanded in 1849."
