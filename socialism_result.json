A number of them, influenced by the thought of French utopian socialist Charles Fourier, founded a club dedicated to creating a society based on his ideas in 1843 and organized a \"phalanx\" (a communal living complex) in Fond du Lac county the following year. Notable members of the club include Charles Durkee, the first Republican member of the US Senate; Louis Harney, who would later become Governor; and Charles Latham Sholes, newspaper editor and inventor of the QWERTY keyboard. The commune disbanded in 1849."

In 1923 drew up his plans and, through his role in county government and the enactment of the nation's first county zoning ordinances in 1927, he began making them a reality piece by piece, including Grant, Estabrook, and Brown Deer parks as well as Lincoln Memorial Drive."
